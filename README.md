NinePatchChunk
==============

This is a simple Android library which allows you to create a chunk for NinePatchDrawable at runtime. So you are able to load 9.png images, for example, from assets of your application or from other source.<br>
The solution based on <b>[this](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Gallery2/+/android-4.2.2_r1.2/src/com/android/gallery3d/ui/NinePatchChunk.java)</b> implementation from Android Open Source Project.<br>
Additional information about 9-patch chunk structure you can find <b>[here](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/include/androidfw/ResourceTypes.h)</b>.
